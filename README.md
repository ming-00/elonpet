Elonpets spawn on your VSCode IDE, bombard you with tweets, micromanage & scold you for every error. If you fail your surprise code review, ElonPet scrubs your code & kicks you out of Twitter HQ.

## What it does
Have you ever wanted Elon Musk to be your boss? Us too! This is why we built ElonPet, the stuff of every dev's dreams. Ensure you reach peak productivity with necessary features such as: 
<br />
🐦 Small elonpets running around your IDE
<br />
🐦 Tweets from Elon delivered straight to you every few seconds
<br />
🐦 Getting yelled at with every error you make
<br />
🐦 Watching Elon's face grow with disgust if your code gets too nasty
<br />
🐦 Surprise code reviews: as an employee, you have signed away your rights and are subject to random code checks. Your code will be printed and inspected by Elon. Failure to pass his stringent requirements will result in **very dire consequences**. You have been warned.
