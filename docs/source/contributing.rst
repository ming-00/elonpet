Drawing and Animations
++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to contribute improvements to the animations, additional pet colors or even new pets, clone the repository and work in the `media/` folder.  

Most drawings are done in `aseprite <https://www.aseprite.org/>`_ because you can edit GIFs directly. However, you are free to use any tool to make the animations. Animations should be 8 frames per second. The style of the extension is to have pixelated creatures (although not limited to an 8-bit color canvas).  

Don't worry if you don't have enough coding experience to add the changes to the extension to support the new animations, we can help you with that.  

The minimum set of behaviors is:

* standing
* walking
* running/chasing
* holding green ball

Testing the changes  
+++++++++++++++++++

-   Run `npm install`.
-   Run `npm run compile`.
-   Go to the debug panel on the sidebar and launch the development version with the extension loaded (first option in the debug profiles).
-   Refer to `VS Code Extension Documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/api>`_ for additional resources.

Submitting a PR
+++++++++++++++

- Please make sure to run `npm run lint` and verify there are no errors/warnings. 
- You can run `npm run lint:fix` to fix the lint issues.
